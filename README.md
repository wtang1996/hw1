* This is the screen cap of my layout stage:

* I used the inspector to examine the structure of the slack.com page. I only copied the styling for the submit button and I decided to customize the rest. I didn't use <span> tag at all. Also, I got my background image online.
* I mostly used flex box for layout and it worked out perfectly. Meanwhile, I am still a little bit confused about the difference between padding and margin when I used them.
